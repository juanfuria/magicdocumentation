        <p>The Handpoint Handpoint platform a.k.a headstart on Windows Mobile/CE provides an application programming interface simplifying the development of your payment solutions considerably.</p>
        <p>You as a POS application developer can link your C++ based app to our heft.dll for integration with Handpoint on a Windows Mobile/CE platform.</p>
        <p>The SDK includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sample apps: &nbsp;</strong>A WTL (Windows Template Library) based Windows Mobile/CE sample applications .</li>
            <li><strong>Sample app source code:</strong>&nbsp;Giving you an indication on how to use our library.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation: </strong>Doxygen&nbsp;documentation which can be viewed in browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Libs</strong>: C++ .lib and .dll files for development.</li>
            <li><strong>Header/include files:</strong>&nbsp;C++ header files with function prototypes, structs and defines needed for integration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Heft&nbsp;module is packaged as Dynamic linked library named&nbsp;heft.dll. Its name is an abbreviation of Handpoint Electronic Funds Transfer. It contains pure C++ implementation of EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) protocol, which is used for communication between Handpoint library and PED device.</p>
        <p>Central part of Handpoint Windows Mobile/CE solution is the Handpoint&nbsp;Library. This library provides core functionality, including interaction with&nbsp;PED&nbsp;device and communication with payment gateway. Those integrators who wish to integrate Handpoint&nbsp;solution into their C++ based products, will most likely use Handpoint&nbsp;Library directly from their C++ based applications for these purposes.</p>
